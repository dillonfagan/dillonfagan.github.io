      <p>I grew up around my family's garage door business in Rhode Island. When I was 14, I started helping in the office with paperwork, and later their marketing efforts and tech modernization.</p>
      <p>In 2018, I graduated from the University of Rhode Island with a B.S. Computer Science and a German language minor.</p>
      <p>Since then, I've traversed the entire tech stack at eMoney Advisor, where I've worked on web scrapers, REST APIs, and React web apps.</p>
      <p>In 2021, I co-founded <a href="https://www.pvdthings.coop" target="_blank">PVD Things</a>, Providence's first cooperative "library of things," a non-profit that lends tools and recreational items without charging rent. Members pay annual dues on a sliding scale to cover operating costs.</p>
      <p>During my spare time, I maintain open source software to streamline operations at the library.</p>
